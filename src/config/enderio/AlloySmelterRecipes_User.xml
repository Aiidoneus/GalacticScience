<!--
  Custom recipes that will not be over written by Ender IO are added here. Examples of recipes can be found in the
  AlloySmelterRecipes_Core.xml and general format documentation in the SAGMillRecipes_Core/User.

  As well as adding custom recipes to the operation of the Alloy Smelter, a vanilla furnace recipe can be controlled.
  It can be disabled completely by simply adding this line:

  <vanillaFurnaceRecipes enabled="false" />

  It is also possible to selectively disable vanilla furnace recipes. The following example disables the smelting of iron
  ingots, ender pearls, and any form of iron ore registered in the ore dictionary.

  <vanillaFurnaceRecipes>

	<exclude>
      <itemStack modID="minecraft" itemName="iron_ingot" />
      <itemStack modID="minecraft" itemName="ender_pearl" />
      <itemStack oreDictionary="oreIron" />
    </exclude>

  </vanillaFurnaceRecipes>

  Add this line to disable the creation of TE alloys using the Alloy Smelter.

  <recipeGroup name="Thermal Expansion" enabled="false" />
